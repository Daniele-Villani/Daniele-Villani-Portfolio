# Hello, I'm Daniele

I am a dedicated and self-taught student specializing in cybersecurity and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
Driven by a passion for protecting digital assets and securing information systems, I have independently pursued knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.

Recently, I successfully completed the Junior System and Cybersecurity Analyst course at Generation Italy, 
an intensive program that provided me with a strong foundation in networking principles and a comprehensive understanding of both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) cybersecurity strategies.
Throughout this course, I gained practical experience in various aspects of cybersecurity and networking.
In addition to the technical skills acquired, the program emphasized the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving, which are essential in navigating the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

As I continue to build on this solid foundation, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and further develop my expertise in both red team penetration testing and blue team defense mechanisms.

## Objective

I am highly motivated and committed to continuous learning, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills through a variety of platforms and personal projects. 
I take an active approach to my professional development, recently starting to document my journey and the insights I gain along the way.

My current objective is to achieve the position of a Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst, where I can apply my acquired knowledge, enhance my expertise, and contribute to safeguarding organizational assets. 
I am focused on building a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles, threat detection, and incident response to excel in this role and advance within the industry.
